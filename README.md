## GOV.UK Content Best Practices

This repository hosts snapshots of gov.uk pages acting as examples of pages using content best practices.

## Adding new pages

- Create a new file in GitHub [TODO: tell how]()
- Paste the contents of [the template file](/template.html) there.
- Open the original page that you want to take a snapshot of and copy HTML within the `<article>` tag there. (TODO: instructions)
- Replace {{Content goes there}} with everything withing the `<article>` tag of the original page.
- Open a pull request with the new file explaining the changes
- Someone will review the changes and merge them to the `gh-pages` branch, which will make the new page available at http://alphagov.github.io/govuk-content-best-practices/{your-file-name}.html
